Hello! 

I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the 
[Computer Science](https://cs.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"} department 
at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}.
I primarily teach undergraduate courses in Computer Science, mentor students, and engage in research in CS education, computational social science, and in data & information science.

I am currently the CS Department's director/coordinator of the [Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"} and the co-director of the Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULA) program. I am also the faculty advisor for the Class of 2026 undergraduate CS students.

I earned my Ph.D. in Information Science at Rutgers University from the School of Communication and Information ([SC&I](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu){:target="_blank"}) in 2018. 
I also have an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [USC Viterbi](https://viterbi.usc.edu){:target="_blank"}. I previously had a career of many years in the tech industry as an engineer and manager.

I am passionate about teaching computer and information technology to *everyone* (i.e. those with and without an affinity for computers, math, or engineering)
and see a continued huge demand by people of different work and educational backgrounds wanting to learn computational and data science technologies
at all levels. At my core, I am an educator, an engineer, and a social technologist. 
I have had the honor of being recognized several times for my teaching, most recently winning the Outstanding Faculty in Computer Science Award at UCSB in 2025. 

My Erd≈ës number is no more than 5; my Berners-Lee number is no more than 3; my Matni number is exactly zero! :)

My decidedly non-academic hobbies include music performance, international cooking, open-world gaming, and reading (well, does listening to a lot of audiobooks count?)
